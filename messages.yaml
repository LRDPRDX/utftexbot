  This bot will render your LaTeX code and send it back
  to you in a form of a (pretty printed) message,
  so you can see and copy it. I use this awesome FOSS -
  https://github.com/bartp5/libtexprintf to do it. Check it out !
  I will add more functionality later and make the code FOSS when it's done.

  ☝This bot *doesn't* collect or track *any* data from the users.

  *Commands:*

  /start  - This message
  /help   - More details about the bot
  /tex    - Render LaTeX
  /ping   - Check if the bot is alive
  /state  - Your current state
  /cancel - To cancel your current state/action

  *Don't flood*, please. Otherwise you'll be *blocked* !

  /start  - General info. Try to see.

  /ping   - Check if the bot is alive. Sends you 🚀 as a response if alive, nothing otherwise.

  /tex    - ☝ *This is what you want.* Type som eLaTeX and this bot will render and send it back
  to you in a form of a message, so you can copy it, for example.

  /tex `LaTeX code` will render `LaTeX code` immediately. For example, `/tex \frac{1}{2}`.

  /tex    - Same as above but takes two steps: it considers your next message is what to render.

  /state  - Mostly for debugging purpose.
  It tells the current state you're in.
  In other words, what the bot is waiting for from you.
  For example, if you've just sent `/tex` to the bot it is waiting for `LaTeX code` to process.

  /cancel - Resets your current state. Use this command when you want to start from scratch.
